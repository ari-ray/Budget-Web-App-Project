# Budget-Web-App-Project: PROTOTYPE & REFACTORED VERSION

A web-based budget and finance tracking application built using Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and later integrated with database and CSV export function.

This is just the prototype.
** The main Project is stored in the "MAIN_PROJECT" directory of this repository. **

The project was initiated to develop an undersatanding of full-stack development. The prototype only used in-memory storage and did not include validation. Later in the **refactored version in the "MAIN_PROJECT" ** directory, a database has been integrated, validation has been added and functionalities have been improved. The repository shows the learning curve of the full-stack development from the prototype to the refactored version.
